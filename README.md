# Build an interactive website for Perfect-Lab-System

This website is published at the branch gh-pages.

Although GitHub pages is for static website, we can add some dynamic components to it. I'll start with [this blog](https://medium.com/pan-labs/dynamic-web-apps-on-github-pages-for-free-ffac2b776d45).

Good luck to myself.

Check [this great video guide by Alqama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl-qlxfTJHE) to build up a website with Google Firebase.

Also [the offical guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart).
