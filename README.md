# Build an interactive website for Perfect-Lab-System

This website is published at the branch gh-pages.

Although GitHub pages is for static website, we can add some dynamic components to it. I'll start with [this blog](https://medium.com/pan-labs/dynamic-web-apps-on-github-pages-for-free-ffac2b776d45).

Good luck to myself.
